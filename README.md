# Most Popular Baby Names by Region 2018
Parsing ONS data to find the UK's most popular boy &amp; girl names in 2018 by UK county.

## Summary

Although it'll be a good many years until I have children myself, I was curious about this question when my brother and my sister-in-law
were choosing a name for their daughter. None of the baby names websites appear to have this information but I think it's very important.
Firstly, because name popularity can differ across regions and the popularity of a name clearly influences the parents' decision. Secondly
I think it's nice how name popularity can show cultural differences within the UK.

##Â Screenshots

Currently I only have screenshots for the girls' names. The colour palette is slightly regrettable as some of the colours are too similar to one another.
However, the real graph allows you to hover over regions to view the name which is more useful than the original, contrasting colour scheme.
